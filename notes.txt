build the HTML and the input

access the library API
	hardcode the category first
	https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/subjects/ 


look at it in Postman: http://openlibrary.org/subjects/mystery.json
	dig out the cover, title and author
	create the fetch
		write a function that takes in a string, and runs the API request

wire the input later
1. build the HTML


function that returns the random book:
	is ebooks_count the real count? if so, use it
	use works.length as the max in our random function
	Math.floor(Math.random * works.length)
	access at: works[randomIndex]

present the info from the API on the DOM
	fields we need: cover image, author, title
	build helper function to generate the elements, then append them

wire up the input:
	add an eventListener to the button
	grab the input via a querySelector and get its text
	pass this into the search
